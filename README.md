# 🛒 Walmart Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard

### 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Walmart’s historical sales data** to uncover key business insights and visualize them using **Python** and **Power BI**.  
The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and external factors influencing sales performance across multiple stores and departments.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess Walmart sales data using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify sales trends  
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for visualization  
- Highlight the impact of factors such as holidays, fuel prices, temperature, and CPI on sales  
- Generate insights to support **data-driven decision-making**  

---

### 🧠 Motivation
The retail industry faces challenges like unpredictable sales, seasonality, and changing customer demand.  
By leveraging analytics and visualization, this project helps Walmart understand:
- How holidays and seasons impact sales  
- Which stores perform best  
- How economic indicators (CPI, Unemployment) affect performance

### 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Importing dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, fixing data types, removing outliers
3. **Feature Engineering** – Adding new columns (Month, Year, HolidayWeek)
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing trends and correlations
5. **Dashboard Creation** – Using **Power BI** to design interactive dashboards
6. **Insights Generation** – Identifying top-performing stores, sales trends, and key factors

---

### 📈 Key Insights
- Sales peak during **holiday seasons** (Thanksgiving, Christmas) with a **35–45% increase**
- **Store 20** recorded the highest weekly sales among all outlets
- **CPI** and **Unemployment** show negative correlation with weekly sales
- **Fuel price** has minimal impact on sales performance
- Integrated dashboard allows management to **filter, analyze, and forecast** sales easily

---

### 🧩 Dashboard Features (Power BI)
- **Interactive Filters** – View by year, store, and holiday
- **KPI Cards** – Total sales, average weekly sales, store ranking
- **Visuals** – Line charts, bar graphs, and correlation plots
- **Drill-Down Analysis** – Compare departments and regional performance

---

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Add **machine learning models** (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) for sales forecasting  
- Integrate **real-time data** using APIs or cloud (Azure, Power BI Service)  
- Include **customer demographics and marketing spend** for deeper insights  
- Deploy dashboard on **web/cloud platforms** for live access
